# ICS32 tic tac toe

Using python to create a tic tac toe game using GUI.

Assuming our tic tac toe game uses a 3 x 3 board, we will use x/X and o/O for the valuesthat we will be passing back and forth. For those not familiar with Tic Tac Toe, it is a 2 player gamewhere one player's game piece is X and the second player's game piece is O (letter). Each playertakes a turn putting their game piece in one of the empty slots in the 3 by 3 board. First place toget 3 of their game pieces that align wins. If the board has no empty slots and nobody wins thenthe game ends in a tie.
