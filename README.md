# ICS32 tic tac toe

Using python to create a tic tac toe game using GUI.

Assuming our tic tac toe game uses a 3 x 3 board, we will use x/X and o/O for the values that we will be passing back and forth. 
For those not familiar with Tic Tac Toe, it is a 2 player game where one player's game piece is X and the second player's game piece is O (letter). 
Each player takes a turn putting their game piece in one of the empty slots in the 3 by 3 board. 
First place to get 3 of their game pieces that align wins. 
If the board has no empty slots and nobody wins then the game ends in a tie.
